            shortest path means the shortest path 
            from point a to point b, but in this situation 
            a set number of nodes must be visited so the shortest path 
            run wouldn't work cause it might exclude the required nodes in the set. 

            choosing which path from S to the required nodes in the set 
            would be most optimal and the least amount of weight.

            Because the order of how the required nodes are visited may 
            amount to a different weight depending on the paths that taken 
            for example a node could have 2 possible paths to different nodes and depending on which 
            node the path took previously the weights could be different, amounting to a different total cost.
